- **Recommendation Engine:** Develop a recommendation system that suggests events to users based on their profiles and past event attendance. Consider using machine learning algorithms to improve recommendations over time.
- **Interactive Maps:** Integrate maps and location services to display event locations and help users find events nearby.
- **Ticketing Integration:** Enable users to purchase tickets or register for events directly through the platform by integrating with ticketing and registration services.
